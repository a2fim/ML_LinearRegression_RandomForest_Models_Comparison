Solubility Prediction with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates solubility prediction using machine learning techniques. The dataset is loaded from a provided URL and prepared as features (X) and target values (y).
The data is split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split ratio. Two regression models, Linear Regression and Random Forest, are trained and evaluated.
Performance metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) are calculated for both training and testing data.
The results are displayed in a DataFrame for easy comparison.
Additionally, the predicted solubility values are visualized using a scatter plot.
Feel free to explore the code and analyze the predictions!
